# CSE110-JAVA-PROGRAMMING-I
Java Programming I Assignments
This repository contains assignments from my Java Basics course, where I am learning foundational programming concepts step by step.

1. Introduction to Flowchart :
In this assignment, we focused on understanding and designing flowcharts to represent logical solutions to given problems. The goal was to develop problem-solving skills and logical thinking without writing actual code.

2. Variables and Data Types :
This assignment introduces the fundamental concepts of variables and data types in Java. It includes basic examples of declaring, initializing, and using variables, as well as understanding primitive data types like int, double, char, and more.

3. Branching :
This assignment explores the concept of branching in Java, including conditional statements like if, else if, else, and switch. These are essential for making decisions and controlling the flow of a program based on different conditions.

4. Linear Loops :
In this assignment, we learned about linear loops in Java, focusing on loops like for, while, and do-while. These loops allow repetitive execution of code blocks, making it easier to handle tasks that involve iteration.

5. Nested Loops :
This assignment dives into nested loops, which are placed inside other loops. Nested loops are used to solve more complex problems, such as working with multidimensional data or creating patterns. Examples in this assignment demonstrate how to use nested loops for different scenarios efficiently.

6. Strings :
This assignment introduces the concept of Strings in Java, which are sequences of characters used to represent text. Topics covered include creating strings, concatenation, common string methods like length(), charAt(), substring(), .equals(), and many more. Examples demonstrate how strings can be used for tasks like manipulating text, checking conditions, and formatting output.

7. Arrays :
This assignment focuses on Arrays in Java, which are used to store multiple values of the same type in a single variable. Topics include declaring and initializing arrays, accessing elements, iterating through arrays using loops, and performing basic operations like finding the largest or smallest element. Examples showcase how arrays simplify working with collections of data.
